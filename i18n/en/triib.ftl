# triib's interface text in English, the source for every other language.
#
# Each line is `key = text`. Keys stay the same in every language; only the
# text after `=` is translated. `{ $name }` is a value triib fills in, such
# as an entity's name or a count; keep it, and move it where the language
# needs it. Plural and other variants use Fluent's selectors:
# https://projectfluent.org/fluent/guide/selectors.html
#
# triib controls audio networks built on AVB, Milan and IEEE 1722.1
# (ATDECC). Their terms follow the glossary in docs/GLOSSARY.md: names the
# standards give, such as AVB, Milan, gPTP, CRF, AECP or a descriptor

# and Mb/s.
